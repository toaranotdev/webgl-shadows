# WebGL 2D Shadows
![image](./resources/screenshot.png)

## Why
2D shadows is kind of a niche topic, but understandably so. I don't think this effect is any better than just slapping a simple circular gradient light on top, the extra complexity is not worth it in my opinion. But I like wasting my time implementing stupid shit so ahauwheuahawuehawe.

## How it works
This is basically a WebGL version of [this article on how to implement shadows](https://slembcke.github.io/SuperFastHardShadows)

## Running
Just run a local web server as this thing doesn't have any dependencies and is written in pure WebGL (Also makes the code kind of long and annoying but whatever)
